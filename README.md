# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

### `SUMMERY`

The cryptocurrency dashboard we've created offers several functionalities. Firstly, there's a search bar that allows users to search for specific cryptocurrencies. Once a cryptocurrency is selected, users are directed to a dedicated page for that particular coin, where a history chart displaying the coin's price is shown. 

On the home page, users can view a chart displaying the prices of one or more cryptocurrencies simultaneously by choosing from a dropdown list. Users can also change the range of the data displayed on the chart, from 1 day to 1 year, and switch between a line chart and a bar chart. There's also a custom option for selecting a specific range.

A sidebar displays the market cap of the cryptocurrencies, and users can view their own profile and how many coins they own. There's a crypto exchange dashboard where users can exchange one cryptocurrency for another or for currency. 

Finally, there's a currency changer beside the search bar where users can change the currency of the entire application, and the dashboard features both a dark and light theme. We used several technologies to create this dashboard, including React JS, React Router, Tailwind for CSS, Redux, and Redux Thunk for state management. We utilized the Coingecko API to fetch data for the dashboard.

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
